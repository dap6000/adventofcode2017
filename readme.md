Working through the exercises from http://adventofcode.com/2017 using Atom, vanilla Javascript, and the Firefox console. I'm not concerned with leaderboards or earning points or getting things done quickly. This is a fun way to challenge myself and experiment with language features and approaches that don't often come up in my day to day work.

Eventually I'll try to expand this readme a bit. And add reflections on each day's puzzle.
